## The Variables
Variables found in run_analysis.R
- **activityLabels:** a list containing the activity names found in "activity_labels.txt" (alpha only)
- **features:** a list containing the feature names found in "features.txt"
- **featuresSubset:** a list containing only the features having to do with mean or standard deviation
- **trainData:** a list of training data from "train/X_train.txt". Then turns into a bound dataframe containing the training data, labels and subjects.
- **trainActivities:** a list of training labels from "train/Y_train.txt"
- **trainSubjects:** a list of training subjects from "train/subject_train.txt". Subjects are integers from 1-30.
- **testData:** a list of test data from "test/X_test.txt". Then turns into a bound dataframe containing the test data, labels and subjects.
- **testActivities:** a list of test labels from "test/Y_test.txt"
- **testSubjects:** a list of test subjects from "test/subject_test.txt". Subjects are integers from 1-30.
- **totalData:** the result of merging testData and trainingData


## Transformations
##### Name Transformations
* Activity labels had the numerics removed. Example: "WALKING2" in the raw data became "WALKING" in the tidy data.
* Column names were modified to be more descriptive and readable by expanding the abbreviations:
*  * tBodyAcc in raw data became timeBodyAccelerometer
*  * tBodyGyro in raw data became timeBodyGyroscope
*  * fBodyAcc in raw data became frequencyBodyAccelerometer
*  * fBodyGyro in raw data became frequencyBodyGyroscope
*  * tGravityAcc in raw data became timeGravityAccelerometer
*  * X in raw data became XAxis
*  * Y in raw data became YAxis
*  * Z  in raw data became ZAxis
*  * Mag in raw data became Magnitude
*  * Mag in raw data became Magnitude
*  * Std in raw data became StandardDeviation
*  * Freq in raw data became Frequency
*  * Dashes were removed


*****Data Transformations
* After merging the train and test data sets, the total data set was "melted" so each row contains a unique subject and activity combination
* The melted data is then cast to display the mean of each feature for each subject and activity combination
